# What is Loop ? 
# ---> If you want to run something for certain number of times, we will use a loop.

# There are 2 major types of loops ; 
#     1) For loop       ( When you know something to be executed n number of time, we use for loop)
#     2) While loop     ( When you don't know something to be executed n number of times, we use while loop)


# For Loop Syntax:

for val in 10 20 30 40 50 ; do 
    echo $val 
done
